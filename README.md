## Description of the Project

The goal of the project is to deploy on the server a simple copy of the AirBnB website. 
This first step is very important because we will use what we built during this project 
with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end 
integrationâ€¦

Each task is linked and will helps us to:

- put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of future instances
- create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
- create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Placeâ€¦) that inherit from BaseModel
- create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
- create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine

## Description of the command interpreter:

A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)
